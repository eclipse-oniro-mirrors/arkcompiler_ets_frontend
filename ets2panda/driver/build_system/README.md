# Build system

The build system is designed to build HAR, HSP, and HAP. It takes source code files and build configurations as input, compiles the source files, invokes plugins for transformation, and generates a merged bytecode file.

## How to Run:
```bash
npm install
npm run run
```
Note: Due to certain manual operations required by the current dependency libraries, please refer to this [wiki](https://gitee.com/chenqy930/arkcompiler_ets_frontend/wikis/ArkTS2.0%20build%20system%20use%20guide?sort_id=13233851) for running the project. Otherwise, the process may fail.
