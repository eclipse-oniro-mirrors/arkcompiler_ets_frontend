// Minimal `--key value` / `--flag` parser: no external deps (this runner must work without an
// `npm install` step, since CMake/ctest only ever invokes it via a plain `node run-e2e.js ...`
// command). A token that starts with "--" is a flag; if the following token doesn't itself start
// with "--", it's consumed as that flag's value, otherwise the flag is treated as boolean `true`.
